\section{Introduction}
This project has been developed as part of the course in Intelligent Systems, a.y. 2012/13, by Alberto Franzin and Fabio Palese.

The project consists in a spam classifier for emails based on Bayesian networks, a probabilistic model to represent conditional dependencies between random variables that can be used as a classifier in the field of supervised learning.

The code and the documentation of the project is available at\\ \url{http://code.google.com/p/sist-int-2012project/}.

This documents is divided in four section: in the first one, we briefly introduce the theory behind Bayesian networks, in the second section we describe the working of project, then we show the results that we have obtained and finally we draw the conclusions.
