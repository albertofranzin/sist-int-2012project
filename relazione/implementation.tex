\section{Implementation}
Here we describe our implementation of a Naive Bayes spam classifier. Further documentation is available with the package.

The project has been written in Python. It requires two external modules, \verb!bs4! (\verb!BeautifulSoup!) to parse a text and \verb!Ply! to perform the lexical analysis of a text.

\subsection{Structure}
The package is composed as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[spam\_bayes] the module contianing the \verb!__main__! class;
  \item[naive\_bayes] the module defining the Bayesian network;
  \item[trainer] contains the trainer;
  \item[classifier] applies the Bayesian logic to classify a mail;
  \item[config] contains some general configurations, manages the settings defined by the user;
  \item[gen\_stat] 
  \item[test\_stat]
  \item[lexer] implementing the lexical analyzer to compute the statistics;
  \item[utils] with some methods used in more classes.
\end{description}
