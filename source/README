SpamBayes
=========

Authors: Alberto Franzin, Fabio Palese

This is the software that we have written as part of the examination of Sistemi intelligenti. The software is a spam classifier that uses the Naive Bayes network to accomplish its purpose.

The software contains the following files:
- spam_bayes.py
- naive_bayes.py
- config.py
- trainer.py
- classifier.py
- lexer.py
- utils.py
- gen_stat.py
- test_stat.py
- spam_bayes.conf
and the associated documentation:
- build/latex/SpamBayes.pdf
- build/html/index.html

Settings
--------
There are numerous settings available. For the complete list and the explanation, see the documentation.

To tune the desidered parameters, open the spam_bayes.conf file with your favourite editor and set the values you like better.

Place the mails you want to use in the desidered folder and set the SPAM_DIR and HAM_DIR parameters accordingly.

Beware that no checks are performed, so if the settings are incorrect, the software may crash at any time.

Usage
-----
After all the configurations has been set, launch the program from a terminal using:
$ python /path/of/the/project/spam_bayes.py
